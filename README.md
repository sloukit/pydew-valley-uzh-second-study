# PyDew Valley

PyDew Valley is a project originally created by ClearCode in Python using pygame-ce.

This expanded version will be used by the [University of Zurich's Department of Psychology](https://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/en.html) in an experimental study in social psychology. 

This particular repository covers the versions of the game used for the second part of the study.

For more information, please contact s.kittelberger[at]psychologie.uzh.ch.

### Linting and Formatting

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install it and other relevant dependencies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before opening a PR, please run the following command to ensure that your code is formatted and doesn't upset the Ruff linter:**
> 
> ```sh
> python formatlint.py
> ```
> 
> Or alternatively, run the following commands individually:
> 
> ```sh
> ruff format . && ruff check --select I --fix . #  format code and sort imports
> ruff check . # Run linting and perform fixes accordingly, or use '# noqa: <RULE>' followed by a comment justifying why the rule is ignored
> ```
